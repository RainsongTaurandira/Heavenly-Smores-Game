# Heavenly Smores Game
 Maze game in Unity 2018, for GameDev.tv Game Jam 2022 (May 2022).
 Team of two, with "Enjaku".

 Move with ASWD and pick up items to make s'mores (chocolate, graham crackers, marshmallows, stick).

 Initial test build is playable, but lacks animations and sound; and the counters aren't visible.
